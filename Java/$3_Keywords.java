/*

Keywords--

     - Keywords are reserved words in Java that have a predefined meaning.
     - They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, method names).
     - Java has 50+ keywords, including:
     - Data Types: int, float, double, char, boolean
     - Control Flow: if, else, switch, case, default
     - Loops: for, while, do
     - Access Modifiers: public, private, protected
     - Other: class, interface, extends, implements, try, catch, finally

     - The keywords const and goto are reserved, even though they are not currently used in Java.
     - true, false, and null look like keywords, but in actuality they are literals. However, they still can't be used as identifiers in a program.
     - In Java, keywords are case-sensitive, and writing Java keywords in upper case (like IF instead of if) will throw an error.
