OOP's Concepts -->

OOP's is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using objects and classes, promoting code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

OOP's Concepts include:

1. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity with state and behavior.
3. **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
4. **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, enabling method overriding and overloading.
5. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to some components.
